        <h3 style="color:black; font-size:4ch;">Lyrics:</h3>
        <h4 style="color:black; font-size:4ch;">I.</h4>
        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">Long were the nights when my <br>
            Days once revolved around you <br>
            Counting my footsteps' <br>
            Praying the floor won't fall through, again <br>
            My mother accused me of losing my mind, but I swore <br>
            I was fine <br> </p>
            
        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">You paint me blue sky <br>
            Then go back and turn it to rain <br>
            And I lived in your chess game <br>
            But you changed the rules every day <br>
            Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone Tonight <br>
            Well, I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why</p>

         <h5 style="color:black; font-size:3ch;">Chorus:</h5>
         
        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">Dear John <br>
            I see it all now that you're gone <br>
            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br>
            The girl in the dress cried the whole way home <br>
            I should've known</p>

        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">Well, maybe it's me <br>
            And my blind optimism to blame <br>
            Or maybe it's you and your sick need <br>
            To give love then take it away</p>

        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors <br>
            Who don't understand <br>
            And I'll look back and regret <br>
            I ignored when they said, "Run as fast as you can"</p>

        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">Dear John <br>
            I see it all now that you're gone <br>
            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br>
            The girl in the dress cried the whole way home</p>

        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">Dear John <br>
            I see it all now, it was wrong <br>
            Don't you think nineteen's <br>
            Too young to be played by your dark, twisted games? <br>
            When I loved you so <br>
            I should've known</p>
            
        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">You are an expert at sorry <br>
            And keeping lines blurry <br>
            Never impressed by me acing your tests <br>
            All the girls that you've run dry <br>
            Have tired, lifeless eyes 'cause you burned them out <br>
            But I took your matches before fire could catch me <br>
            So don't look now <br>
            I'm shining like fireworks <br>
            Over your sad empty town <br>
            Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh</p>

        <p style="color:black; font-size: 3ch;">Dear John <br>
            I see it all now that you're gone <br>
            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br>
            The girl in the dress cried the whole way home <br>
            I see it all now that you're gone <br>
            Don't you think I was too young to be messed with? <br>
            The girl in the dress wrote you a song <br>
            You should've known <br>
            You should've known <br>

            Don't you think I was too young? <br>
            You should've known</p>
